# Workshop: Containers with Docker
Containers provide a way of deploying applications without them interfering with each other..

In this two part workshop we take a look at the underlying tech for containers, how to create and run your own Docker containers according to best practices.
However running just a single container is not particulary exiting. So after learning how to make and run one container we will move on to docker-compose and start running(/scaling) multiple dependent containers together.

## Technical Prerequisites

- Docker installed (https://www.docker.com/docker-mac)
- Docker compose installed (should come with docker for mac).
- Clone the git repo (pending).

## Knowledge Prerequisites

- Pending?
